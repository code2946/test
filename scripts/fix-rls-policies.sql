-- FIX RLS POLICIES FOR DISCUSSIONS
-- Run this to fix the "violates row-level security policy" error

-- First, drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all for authenticated users - discussions" ON public.discussions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all for authenticated users - reactions" ON public.discussion_reactions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anonymous read - discussions" ON public.discussions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anonymous read - reactions" ON public.discussion_reactions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view discussions" ON public.discussions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can create discussions" ON public.discussions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own discussions" ON public.discussions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own discussions" ON public.discussions;

-- Create very permissive policies for testing
-- (We'll make them more restrictive later once it's working)

-- Discussions table policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for service role - discussions" 
ON public.discussions FOR ALL
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for authenticated users - discussions" 
ON public.discussions FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow read for everyone - discussions" 
ON public.discussions FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (true);

-- Reactions table policies  
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for service role - reactions" 
ON public.discussion_reactions FOR ALL
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for authenticated users - reactions" 
ON public.discussion_reactions FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow read for everyone - reactions" 
ON public.discussion_reactions FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (true);

-- Alternatively, if you want to disable RLS temporarily for testing:
-- ALTER TABLE public.discussions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE public.discussion_reactions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- To re-enable later:
-- ALTER TABLE public.discussions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE public.discussion_reactions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
